This is an extremely simple bash script that takes a search phrase and searches through all txt files in the directory for that search phrase
The text files must be in the same directory as the script

To run this script make the file executable via: chmod +x multi-txt-file-search.sh 
Then run it with ./multi-txt-file-search.sh "your search phrase"
The search phrase is the phrase you need search for in the txt file collection
